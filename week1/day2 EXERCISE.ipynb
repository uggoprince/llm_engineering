      "\t* Example: `let isAdmin = true;`\n",
      "4. **Symbol**: A symbol is a unique value that cannot be replicated.\n",
      "\t* Example: `const id = Symbol('unique');`\n",
      "5. **Null** and **Undefined**: These are used to indicate that a variable has not been assigned a value.\n",
      "\t* Example: `let nullValue = null;` or `let undefinedValue = undefined;`\n",
      "\n",
      "**Operators**\n",
      "\n",
      "JavaScript supports various operators:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Arithmetic Operators:\n",
      "\t* `+`: Addition\n",
      "\t* `-`: Subtraction\n",
      "\t* `*`: Multiplication\n",
      "\t* `/`: Division\n",
      "\t* `%`: Modulus (remainder)\n",
      "2. Comparison Operators:\n",
      "\t* `==` or `===`: Equal to\n",
      "\t* `!=`, `!==`: Not equal to\n",
      "\t* `>`: Greater than\n",
      "\t* `<`: Less than\n",
      "3. Logical Operators:\n",
      "\t* `&&` and `&&=`: Logical AND\n",
      "\t* `||` and `||=`: Logical OR\n",
      "4. Assignment Operators:\n",
      "\t* `=`: Assignment\n",
      "\t* `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`: Increment or decrement\n",
      "\n",
      "**Control Structures**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **If Statement**: Used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.\n",
      "\t* Example: `if (isAdmin) alert('You are an admin');`\n",
      "2. **For Loop**: Used to iterate over a sequence of values.\n",
      "\t* Example: `for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { console.log(i); }`\n",
      "3. **While Loop**: Used to execute a block of code while a condition is true.\n",
      "\t* Example: `let i = 0; while (i < 5) { console.log(i); i++; }`\n",
      "\n",
      "**Functions**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Defining Functions**: A function is a block of code that can be executed multiple times with different inputs.\n",
      "\t* Example: `function greet(name) { console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); }`\n",
      "2. **Calling Functions**: You can call a function by using the function name followed by parentheses with the required arguments.\n",
      "\t* Example: `greet('John Doe');`\n",
      "\n",
      "**Arrays**\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrays are used to store values in a collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Creating Arrays**: You can create arrays by encasing values within square brackets `[]`.\n",
      "\t* Example: `[1, 2, 3]`\n",
      "2. **Accessing Array Elements**: You can access array elements using their index position.\n",
      "\t* Example: `let arr = [1, 2, 3]; console.log(arr[0]);`\n",
      "\n",
      "**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**\n",
      "\n",
      "JavaScript supports the basic OOP concepts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Classes**: Classes are used to define a blueprint for an object.\n",
      "\t* Example: `class Car { constructor(name) { this.name = name; } }`\n",
      "2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is not directly supported in JavaScript, but you can achieve similar behavior using prototypal inheritance or implementing interfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "**DOM and Events**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ** DOM (Document Object Model)**: The DOM represents the structure of a document, including HTML elements.\n",
      "\t* Example: `let paragraph = document.querySelectorAll('p');`\n",
      "2. **Events**: Events are triggered by user interactions (e.g., clicks, keyboard input).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is just a basic introduction to JavaScript. As you progress in your learning journey, you'll discover more about advanced concepts like modules, classes, and object-oriented programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "How would you like to proceed? Do you have any specific questions or topics you'd like me to cover next?\n"
