Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you do this with me, either at the same time, or (perhaps better) right afterwards. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today.

Or perhaps collaborations with tech firms to integrate payment solutions.\n",
